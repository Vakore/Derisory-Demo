# Derisory-Demo
A demo of my work in progress game Derisory.
![derisory-demo-picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94314052/141704647-ee7459f3-f05b-406d-a3cd-c550d3d52de2.png) 

HOW TO INSTALL:
 1. Download the ZIP file called derisory v0.31
 2. Unzip it's contents into a new folder. Call it whatever you want.
 3. Launch 'derisory.html' with a web browser(Google Chrome recommended as that is the only one this has beent tested on)
 4. Refresh the page upon firing it up the first time.
 5. (OPTIONAL AND NOT ALWAYS NEEDED) If you notice your game running at unusual speeds(lag, high speeds), or stuttering, try refreshing your page/closing other windows/tabs. If this doesn't work, restart your PC. If this doesn't work after a few attempts, modify the gameSpeed.txt file and read the instructions there carefully.
 6. Z on keyboard or A on controller to select stuff, and X on both to go back. Enter or Pause to pause.
 7. Go to options for fullscreen

I've only tested this in Google Chrome. If it works in other browsers that is great, but if something doesn't work that may be why.

Here are some links if you want them. If you don't then no need to read below.

P.S. There are sequence breaks you can do without the bonus dev abilities. If you do them you'll just get into rooms that wrap into themselves, but performing them will make you feel cool!

P.P.S. hold X to speed up the dying animation if you get tired of it.

CHANGES:
v1.01 - Added FPS cap code due to people with super computers games running at 120fps, causing the game to run at twice the speed.
v1.02 - Add gameSpeed.txt file. It can be modified if your game is running too choppy or too fast.
v1.03 - The FPS capping is now toggleable in gameSpeed.txt. If the game is too fast, you can turn it on. Otherwise you can leave it alone.
v1.04 - I am pretty sure this new fix is the one that will work the best.

v1.10 - Fixed a variety of bugs, including saving custom controls not working, the healing prompt not showing the right button, and more.
- Fixed sitting at campfires not working when having multiple buttons set to jump

v1.20 - FINALLY fixed the FPS cap code. It didn't handle 144fps displays. Now it should any displays that are faster than the game.
- Added difficulty settings. Casual is easier than v1.10 and Tough is harder than v1.10. There is no normal mode as I feel like that would confuse people when deciding what difficulty to play on.
- Fixed a few bugs including quitting when dying locking the screen, and a visual bug regarding a few breakable walls.
- Added a particle when you kill smaller flies.

v1.21 - Added particles on the fly eggs
- Change the position of a fly in a room so that it won't hide in spikes when entering from a certain way

v1.22 - Fixed a crash to do with opening save files after quitting in a different area.

v1.30 - Sleep Frog Swamp Update!
- Added new bosses and a new area
- Added a shop
- Added more items
- Added more coins
- Added more secret rooms to the Infested Mines
- Fixed a multitude of bugs
- Added polish
- Fixed some hitboxes
- Changed some lines of dialog

v1.31
- Fixed a subtle performance issue with fullscreen. Had little impact unless recording the screen, has now been fixed. Lowering the screen scale can increase performance even further but can cause blur.

* Known bugs: having multiple buttons set to an action on keyboard effects controller. I am not super concerned about this right now, but just note that you should not have the same button bound to multiple actions on keyboard if you want to use controller. I am just saying this for those who want to use UP to jump and attack up. If you only use keyboard, do not worry about this.

* Using UP to jump and attack upwards has not been tested for everything, so it probably won't work in some places, especially the new Sleep Frog Swamp content. You'll either have to not bind them to the same button or unbind them when you need to.
