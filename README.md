# Derisory-Demo
A demo of my work in progress game Derisory.

I originally wanted it to work in the web browser without downloading it, however my current code will not work due to the way I was loading scripts when changing areas and Google Chrome being overly sensitive to loading files dynamically. I could change the code, however my current solution is to just have it as a download. The areas will load faster anyways and it'll save you tons of bandwidth from not having to load the 130 files over the internet every time you want to run the game.

HOW TO:
 1. Download the ZIP file called derisory-demo
 2. Unzip it's contents into a new folder. Call it whatever you want.
 3. Launch 'derisory.html'
 4. If the game is too fast, go to 'gameSpeed.txt' and fiddle with the settings until it suits you(You'll know it when you see it. If everything seems normal skip this step)
 5. Z on keyboard or A on controller to select stuff, and X on both to go back. Enter or Pause to pause.
 6. Go to options for fullscreen

I've only tested this in Google Chrome. If it works in other browsers that is great, but if something doesn't work that may be why.

Here are some links if you want them. If you don't then no need to read below.

P.S. There are two sequence breaks you can do without the bonus dev abilities. If you do them you'll just get into rooms that wrap into themselves, but performing them will make you feel cool!

P.P.S hold X to speed up the dying animation if you get tired of it.

CHANGES:
v1.01 - Added FPS cap code due to people with super computers games running at 120fps, causing the game to run at twice the speed.
v1.02 - Add gameSpeed.txt file. It can be modified if your game is running too choppy or too fast.
v1.03 - The FPS capping is now toggleable in gameSpeed.txt. If the game is too fast, you can turn it on. Otherwise you can leave it alone.
